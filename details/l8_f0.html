  <h2>Explanations</h2>
  <pre>&quot;Patterns include the use of \&quot; marks\&quot; and \&quot;each\&quot; together, numerals with periods and in series, and the tokens \&quot;All\&quot;, \&quot;new\&quot;, \&quot;ground\&quot;, \&quot;Post\&quot;, and \&quot;disc\&quot; in contexts of initiation or creation. The token \&quot; is\&quot; serves to define or explain, while \&quot;:\&quot; is used for time notation. Numerical sequences with hyphens or arrows, and time formats are also observed. The token \&quot;er\&quot; marks comparative adjectives, and \&quot; Post\&quot; indicates a forum post. \&quot;predictions\&quot; appears in betting contexts, and \&quot; Per\&quot; is part of a name and location.&quot;</pre>
